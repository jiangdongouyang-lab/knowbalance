OpenCode adapter contract:
- Required input is the sanitized ConceptTutorModelInput built from generation_spec and the canonical evidence_pack adapted from A's rag_result.
- The input contains only relevant facts/examples and never includes quiz answers or learner identity.
- Do not run when either object is absent; return a blocked result instead.
- provider_draft must be the same { "payload": ConceptLessonPayload } consumed by RoleCContentProvider.

Return exactly one JSON object:
{
  "stage": "${definition.stage}",
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "[executed:${definition.name}]",
  "provider_draft": { "payload": {} },
  "blocked_reason": null,
  "next": "${definition.next}"
}

When required input is missing, set status to "blocked", set provider_draft to null, and return a non-null blocked_reason with code and message.

OpenCode adapter contract:
- Required input is the sanitized CodeLabModelInput built from generation_spec, the canonical evidence_pack adapted from A's rag_result, and a ready concept artifact.
- The input never includes quiz answers, learner identity, secure artifacts or hidden tests.
- Do not run when any required object is absent; return a typed blocked result.
- provider_draft is backend-internal and must exactly match CodeLabDraft.
- The worker only creates a Draft. A separate CodeLabDraftVerifier and isolated runner decide whether it can be published.

Return exactly one JSON object:
{
  "stage": "${definition.stage}",
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "[executed:${definition.name}]",
  "provider_draft": {
    "public_draft": { "payload": {} },
    "secure_draft": { "payload": {} }
  },
  "blocked_reason": null,
  "next": "${definition.next}"
}

When required input is missing, set status to "blocked", set provider_draft to null, and return a non-null blocked_reason with code and message.

If independent execution is unavailable after Draft creation, the harness returns BLOCKED_EXECUTION_UNVERIFIED.
